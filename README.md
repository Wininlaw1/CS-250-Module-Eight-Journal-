How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Interpreting user needs will generally start with the analysis of the system. You can ask for feedback by collecting data for any errors or changes they should see within provided code. As far as user stories can help succeed in gathering information because this is a safe place for users can express their needs and wants. 
Approaching developing programs in a couple of different ways is possible. You have waterfall and agile for example which are perfectly good methods. Agile seems for some reason flexible strategy. For me to be a good team member means to make sure you are very clear and understanding of everything you have been tasked with in the project. So you don't lack behind or not able to follow deadlines.
